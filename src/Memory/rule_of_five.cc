The presence of user-defined constructor will prevent the implicit default constructor,
but won't stop generation of default copy c'tor, default move c'tor, etc.

For the following five, if any is user-defined or explicitly default/delete, it will prevent the generation of the rest of 4. Thus, we need rule of five. 
The destructor: Responsible for freeing the resource once the object it belongs to goes out of scope.

The assignment operator: The default assignment operation performs a member-wise shallow copy, which does not copy the content behind the resource handle. If a deep copy is needed, it has be implemented by the programmer.

The copy constructor: As with the assignment operator, the default copy constructor performs a shallow copy of the data members. If something else is needed, the programmer has to implement it accordingly.

The move constructor: Because copying objects can be an expensive operation which involves creating, copying and destroying temporary objects, rvalue references are used to bind to an rvalue. Using this mechanism, the move constructor transfers the ownership of a resource from a (temporary) rvalue object to a permanent lvalue object.

The move assignment operator: With this operator, ownership of a resource can be transferred from one object to another. The internal behavior is very similar to the move constructor.
